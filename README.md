# Customer-Funnel-Analysis

Customer Funnel Analysis is a crucial methodology used in marketing and sales to understand the journey a customer takes from the initial interaction with a brand to the final conversion, such as a purchase. This process involves tracking and analyzing the various stages that potential customers pass through, commonly referred to as the "funnel stages." These stages typically include awareness, interest, consideration, intent, evaluation, and purchase.

The primary purpose of funnel analysis is to identify where customers drop off in their journey and to understand the factors that influence their decisions at each stage. By examining the conversion rates between stages, businesses can pinpoint bottlenecks, optimize their marketing strategies, and improve the overall customer experience. This leads to more effective targeting, higher conversion rates, and increased revenue.

In this project, we will conduct a detailed customer funnel analysis, evaluating the performance at each stage of the funnel. We will assess the number of users entering each stage, the conversion rates, and identify areas for improvement. This analysis will provide actionable insights to enhance customer acquisition, engagement, and retention strategies, ultimately driving business growth.
